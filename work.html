            <div class="project-info-jonas"> Filmed over seven years, this
                documentary tells the story of an award-winning utopian architectural installation at the top of the
                sacred Songshan mountain in China. Designed by a Latvian architect Austris Mailītis and commissioned
                by
                a Chinese investor Mr. Zhu, who, despite the language barrier, become the best companions in
                creating the World’s first open-air building for flying performance. The film reveals the investor's
                attempt to build an architectural wonder
                according to Western standards, while the architect seeks to embody the values of Eastern philosophy
                by inviting monks from the nearby world-famous Shaolin Monastery to participate in flying
                performances. As the construction of the
                object begins, the architect and the investor themselves have to levitate between their cultural
                differences, conventions and personal ambitions.

                This playful dreamy sequence, based on a poem by Jackson Hobert, is set around the Zenbudhistic idea of
                "gaining by letting go". The story itself, as well as its formal aspects, are spontaneous and game-like:
                the creator is the one being created at the same time, there is no beginning nor the end. The
                ever-changing scale of the objects plays with the viewer's perspective reminding of the relativity of
                everything around us.

                Sound We See: Riga is an experimental audiovisual story told
                by 24 artists, architects, writers, photographers, directors, designers and musicians from Riga,
                capturing 24-hours cycle in different parts of the city on 16mm. The analog filmmaking
                techniques and the “City Symphony” genre practiced by Wclasserimg-fluid Ruttmann and Dziga Vertov in
                the 1920s, were used as the starting points to explore the communal creative process and
                contemporary environment of the city. The
                project is part of Sound We See series initiated and mentored by Lisa Marr and Paolo Davanzo (Echo
                Park Film Center, Los Angeles U.S.). Original music score by Platons Buravickis.

                The exhibition was born of a wish to tell about those vivid figures of Latvian extraction who
                have managed to leave their mark on the global history of art - about the art of becoming a
                cosmopolitan without losing one’s identity.
                And simultaneously it is a question of/point of reference for the issue of national art in the
                global
                age -so topical in the 21st century. Is it possible at all? Does affiliation to a specific
                geographical
                and national space naturally and on an almost unconscious level means a set of shared features as
                far as artistic expression is involved - or perhaps national identity and roots still carry a
                significance in a world where traveling around the globe has become a mundane thing? Has art
                has become universal these days? We do not know and not found the answer. But what comes to
                mind is something that someone said while looking at an abstract expressionist explosion of
                energy (painting) by Edvīns Strautmanis - that it had been created by someone who knows that
                the Baltic Sea looked like.

                    Close-Up is a story of resilience, joy, daring and vitality - a story of Latvian artists in New
                    York,
                    one of whom, Svens Lūkins, the rising star of the 1960s American art scene, in 1972, at the
                    height of his career, announced his decision to severe ties with the influential Pace Gallery and
                    never again show his art in any commercial institution. Stoll remembered today, this was a vivid
                    episode od the New York art life of the time. New York - the global epicenter of art, the most
                    significant point of reference on the creative map of the world since the mid-1900s - has always
                    been something like the Promised Land to the ambitious, talented, reckless and strong. It has
                    always been seen as a city where the streets are filled with the air of freedom. Ans it was the
                    ultimate opposite of the world behind the Iron Curtain when Māris Bišofs arrived there. His
                    filigree virtuosic drawings, frequently based on paradoxes of life and always laced with a dose of
                    wit and erudition, became a trademark part of the pages and covers of periodicals like The New
                    York Times, Village Voice, The New Yorker, The Wal Street Journal for many years. In 1981, the
                    painter Vija Celmiņš also moved to New York from California. <br>
                    NYC has not lost its appeal in the 21st century -despite the harsh fight for survival that has
                    become an integral part of life in the city today. Reminiscing about her arrival in New York in
                    1977, Dovanna Pagowski, the favorite model of Robert Mapplethorpe and Richard Avedibm says
                    that it was a completely different place back then: you could become a New Yorker on your first
                    day in the city. No-one was interested in your pedigree or shoes, just in how interesting and
                    original you were. Today’s reality is quite different, and yet artists Astūrs Virtmanis and Signe
                    Baumane are New Yorkers of more than twenty years standing. The painter Julian Schnabel, a
                    friend of Svīns Strautmanis, recalling his youth and the evening spent in the Strautmanis’ lift in
                    Grene Street, says that any artist who wanted to be a success had to move to New York. Is it still
                    the case? Yes, young artists must ho to New York, the artist sats. Agewise, Indriķis Ģelzis is
                    perhaps the youngest testimony to the truth of these words. Are all artists mentioned above
                    American or Latvian artists? And is it even possible to pigeonhole them in this way?

                reconstruct biographies of his “heroes”. By formally repeating the actions of American outsider
                folk artists, author Henry David Thoreau, “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski or Afro-American

                    Jonas Mekas (1922-2019), a Lithuanian-born representative of the American cultural scene, a
                    genuine cult figure of the 20th-century culture – an artist, filmmaker, writer, poet, critic and
                    musician. His art focuses on everything that is going on around him – the everyday life and
                    friends. In the 1950s Jonas Mekas, aged 27, found himself in New York and for his first money
                    bought a Bolex camera. His first subjects were Brooklyn immigrants, later followed by Andy
                    Warhol, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, the blonde Nico – the voice of The Velvet Underground,
                    Salvador Dalí and many others. Not just an outstanding fact of art, today the body of Jonas
                    Mekas work is also a creative chronicle of the New York of the latter half of the 20th century.
                    During his career, Mekas has made dozens of internationally acclaimed films, published several
                    poetry collections and books on film theory, as well as countless newspaper and magazine
                    articles, and forayed into art, creating installations and photographs. In his work, Mekas has
                    often emphasised his Lithuanian roots and found various ways in which to inform the Western
                    society about the fate of the Baltic States.

                    the
                    movement of the dancers. Light “hitting”
                    the film is a physical process - the faster the film moves, the less light is able to get through
                    the
                    lens
                    and vice versa. The faster the film moves, the slower the movement of the dancer appears. In
                    improvised
                    dance, one dancer's
                    movements can affect the movements of the other, in a way similar to the way light, speed, and film
                    are
                    dependent on each other. Performed by Yun Hong Cho and Joan Padeo.
